<p>Hi, I'm Ben. I've been building custom gaming PCs since the mid 1990s, and I've got over 10 years experience working in the IT hardware field. I've worked for local government, installing and delivering new IT hardware. I was also responsible for various trouble shooting/tech support/system repair tasks.</p>
<p>I've also worked for Gladiator Computers and Aria PC, providing customer services and advanced tech support. While working for Aria/Gladiator I did some web development on both their websites, photoshop work (some of which can still be seen on GladiatorPC even now), and advanced technological repairs on hardware that was deemed by the original manufacturer as "beyond repair".</p>
</p>

<div>
<p>I'm currently studying an introduction to coding course with CodeNation, to improve my web development skills and learn programming in general. This website is a part of my work, and will be edited/changed/added to/polished as my skills develop.
</p>
<P>
I'm a complete spice fiend who loves a good curry. I grow my own chillies, including superhot varieties such as Naga Vipers, Bhut Jolokias etc. I've tried growing Carolina Reapers, but had to resort to buying them after the seeds failed to germinate.
</P>

<p>And yes, I do actually eat them. Usually in a home made curry or chilli con carne, however I also make a wide range of chutneys, pickles, and fermented sauces (similar to siracha) using them.</p>

<div><p>In my spare time I like to play games on my PC. One of my favorite genres is flight/space sim style games, such as Digital Combat Simulator, Kerbal Space Program, and Elite Dangerous.</p>
<p>Frequently I'll be joined in game by my son. We also like going for hikes up in the hills with the dogs.</p>
<p>I also like strategy games and shooters, RPGs and stealth 'em ups.</p></div>
