<h2>OUTCOME 1</h2>
<h3>1.1: Describing the purpose of IT in modern business. <br></h3>
<p>IT serves many purposes: Data tracking, such as customer and supplier information, stock monitoring, order history, delivery tracking etc. Other types of data may also be tracked, how many times a user has visited a website, record any support tasks that have been carried out to help a customer are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Websites: If you want your business to remain competitive today, you NEED a website. It may be a simple one that's used to describe your business and give contact information, or it may be more complex and feature an online shop. </p>
<p>Advertising, with promotional materials often created in software like photoshop, then hosted on the company servers along with the website or by an external ad hosting company.</p>
<p>System Automation. Any sort of automation would be impossible without IT. Controlling robotic manufacturing systems such as those found in car factories, driving robots around a warehouse like Amazon uses, cleaning robots such as the roomba, safety systems in cars such as ABS, emergency stop assistance, and autopilot in planes (many of which were pure science fiction just a few years ago!) everything is controlled by computers. </p>
<p>As a customer front, allowing customers to buy products through the company website from the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>Connecting companies with customers/clients for support tasks and other services. This can be done in a variety of way, from having an integrated live chat on the website, to simply listing contact details such as email and phone numbers so that customers can reach you.</p>
<p>Content creation, art work, photo editing, video and music production, and yes even websites... They're all done on a computer.</p>
<p>Accounting tasks, such as staff hours monitoring and wage handling, or payments and invoicing.</p>
<p>Security tasks, for example logging entrance/exits and tying it to time stamped video feeds or taking a photo for each instance.</p>
<p>Used properly IT systems should improve workflow, streamline productivity, and even reduce costs after the initial outlay. Sadly improperly implemented IT systems are apparent in every day life, company systems that require you to manually log everything you’ve done, government systems that require multiple inputs of the same information over and over again, other government systems that don’t communicate with existing systems and get information wrong.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.2: Describing methods, skills, resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
<p>The first thing you need is a vision. What do you want to accomplish with your project? Are you making a game, developing a website for a specific purpose, or developing website templates for use/sale to other companies? Or is it something that most users will never see, such as programming code for machines?</p>
<p>To complete digital projects successfully there are certain requirements. For instance you will need hardware that can handle the task you’re trying to complete. In some cases this may be as simple as a modern phone or tablet device. More advanced work will require the use of laptops, or even multiple computer systems for each of your staff.</p>
<p>Skills required will often depend on the project at hand. Some projects will require a user proficient in image editing using photoshop or gimp for example. Other skills required will include things like HTML editing for websites. Having knowledge of more than one programming language is usually a huge advantage. CSS, Java, Javascript, HTML are a few examples.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT - eg making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3><br>
<a class=link href="https://trello.com/invite/b/AD5CFuMP/923b3b30bd09e22904c76d2255a1550a/benc-dev-coding-assignment-1-dev-coding-websites">INVITE TO TRELLO BOARD</a><br>
<br>
<P>I've recorded tasks on Trello as an exercise for this project. I would not normally use it for a solo project as I'm already well organised when it comes to this sort of thing.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
<p>While everybody knows about external forces such as government agencies around the world, hacker collectives/digital protesters, criminal enterprises, malware infestations and so on, these are actually much less of a threat than modern media would have you believe.</p>
<p>Bigger threats to your project are creator apathy, staff despondency, lack of funding/resources, failure in advertising, and hardware failure. There’s a reason regular backups are considered good practice!</p>
<p>The absolute weakest link that presents a risk, in any IT system is always the end user. Use of unauthorised and possibly compromised devices, visiting dodgy websites, falling for phishing scams and so on.</P>
<p>Other problems could be caused by not having enough time to implement all the features you want/trying to implement too many features in the time available. A good example of this can be seen on my website where I'd like to get a python console running a in a browser instance so that I can host the text based adventure game my team made. I don't think I'll have time to get it working (it's not as straight forward as I'd first hoped), so I'm putting it on the back burner for now while fleshing out other aspects of the website.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h3>
<p>I would look at the job at hand, and if appropriate build or purchase computer systems to specification for the job or jobs at hand. This might involve building and maintaining multiple servers; a front facing one for hosting the website that customers will visit, an email server for your domain, a proxy server to shield the backend from external attacks, and a backup server that takes daily images from the other servers to make sure data is protected in the event of attack or hardware failure.</p>
<p>Other systems may include:</p>
<p>Basic computers for office tasks, accountancy, email, internet research, data entry etc.</p>
<p>Higher specification machines for photo/video editing, 3d creation, software development etc. Something with a lot of CPU power, system RAM, and fast storage mediums such as solid state drives. A Graphics card may also be required, especially in 3D CAD applications. </p>
<p>Storage solutions such as NAS devices and/or RAID arrays may also be appropriate. </p>
<p>Alternatively I may simply need a bunch of tablet devices to hand out to staff so they can record their activity on the go (for instance delivery drivers recording a drop off), or even a simple program that can be added to their own existing phone or tablet device. </p>
<br>
<h3>1.6: Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.– How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h3>
<br>
<p>Software tools like the Github website, Slack and Trello are useful for collaborating with other workers. Github is generally used for hosting the source code of the project at hand, including multiple versions/revisions, while Slack is useful for communicating with other members of your team and sharing ideas. Trello is better suited to organising your team for multiple simultaneous tasks. You can set the tasks, then assign team members to work on specific tasks. You can also keep track of the progress of multiple projects, and multiple tasks in each project.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
<p>Any information that is personally identifiable to a person is subject to GDPR:</p>
<p>Under GDPR, methods digital marketers use to obtain consent will be held to a much higher standard. Changes include:</p>
<list><l>- Active opt-in – Consent will require a positive opt-in through clear affirmative action. Pre-ticked boxes, for example, will no longer be compliant</l><br>
<l>- Granular – Individuals should get as much detail as possible on what their data will be processed for. Best practice will be to let individuals withdraw consent for each distinct processing activity. Blanket consent will not be compliant</l><br>
<l>- Unbundling – Consent requests must be separated from terms and conditions</l><br>
<l>- Not a pre-condition of service – Consent should not be a precondition of signing up to a service unless necessary such as a newspaper subscription</l><br>
<l>- Named – It should be clear to the individual who will be processing their data including any third-parties</l><br></list>
<br>
<p>Under GDPR a person can request copies of any and all information a company may hold on them, which must be supplied within 30 days. They can also request that all the data is deleted so that it can’t be accessed any longer.</p>
<p>GDPR only applies in European countries, as it’s an EU directive.</p>
<p>Anyone that operates a business, or even private technology that holds the data of others is subject to GDPR. This even includes things like dash cam and home cctv footage.</p>

<h2>OUTCOME 2</h2>
<h3>2.1: Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3><br>
<p>Visual Studio Studio code has been indespensible for HTML/CSS creation. While I could do the same thing in notepad++ or most other text editors, VSSC has been a lot more helpful suggesting extra functions. The only problem with it is when it decides to auto complete tags that I'm trying to wrap around a block of text.</p>
<p>Trello has only really been used because it was a requirement of the course. While it may prove to be useful in the future for more complex projects, I've found myself barely referring to it while doing the website project. It was useful in the team project for the text based adventure game though.</p>
<p>I've only just started using codepen, and haven't really had time to form an opinion of it. I will be using it extensively while trying to convert a python script into javascript to run on this website (if I succeed it will be on page 4 "Let's play a game" of this website).</p>
<p>Slack on the other hand has proved very useful. For communicating with the lecturer and other students, sharing code snippets, and keeping track of any changes I've made to the code for the group project.</p>
<p>Trello has only really been used because it was a requirement of the course. While it may prove to be useful in the future for more complex projects, I've found myself barely referring to it while doing the website project.

<br>
<h3>2.2: Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3><br>

<p>VSSC has proved to be very effective in helping me build my website. I could have used other tools such as the system text editor, or notepad++ but VSSC has many features that has made building the website a lot easier. Error checking being the main one, but on occasion the autocomplete feature has come in useful (it’s actually been more of a pain than useful when I’ve been adding tags to large bodies of text that I’ve already written, but that’s on me for doing the large blocks of text first, something I will avoid doing in the future).</p>
<p>Trello hasn't really served any purpose for me in building the website. It has been a little extra work on something that I've not really needed to utilise.</p>
<p>I’ve only just started using codepen to look at javascript, and I have a feeling I’ll be making extensive use of it this afternoon/evening while trying to convert the text based adventure game we made in python so that it will work on my website. If I get it working, I’ll be passing the code on to the other members of my team so they can also use it.</p>
<br>
<h3>2.3: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3> 
<p>My website is currently still a work in progress. I'm pleased with how well it's progressing, but I'm not entirely sure if I'll have time to fully develop the ideas I have in mind for it.</p>
<p>Most pages are feature complete, and follow the same style with some exceptions: Page 4 of my website isn’t complete yet, as I’m hoping to convert the python script that makes up my teams text based adventure game into javascript so it can be included on the website itself. Page 5 of my website utilises a different css sheet for a different style, while still having the same header/footer links. It also uses custom animated gif tool bars that I made myself in Gimp.</p>
<br>
<h3>2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p>One large aspect of my project that I'd like to get working is implementation of a python console, to run the text based adventure game we made in a group as part of the website. I've seen there's some hurdles to doing this, so I'm currently considering my options; do I use an external python hosting service such as pythonanywhere, or should I instead go for the more complicated option of trying to host the console in the browser instance? The latter option will require the use of JavaScirpt which we've not yet learned.</p>
<p>Something else I'd like to get in place is links and images mapping out control configs for flight sim games, and hosting links to download the relevant config files. I've started doing this on page 6 of my website under the heading "Yokes and Trackers". As well as joystick maps and config files, it will also include instructions on how to make your own 3D IR headtracking system for use in games. This is a project I've done myself at home in the past, and while it's not as immersive as using a proper VR headset, it's an effective and much cheaper option allowing you to look around in game without having to press anything. Particularly useful in flight sim games for looking at all the various controls available in the cockpit of a plane, or for keeping your eyes on a target as you fly around them in a dogfight.</p>
<br>
<h3>2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p>Looking back through my outcome responses I feel they answer the questions asked, though in some cases I may have waffled a bit or gone slightly off topic in places.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned faults, I do belive they are fit for purpose.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
<p>Working in a team where we could designate certain tasks to certain team members, is hugely advantageous to many software/webdev roles. However it depends on the size of the project.  For instance building a large website, one person could be doing a few pages of a website, another person doing a  few other pages, someone else could be handling graphics, while another person handles the styling. Working in a team like this would necessitate the use of communication between team members so everyone knows what they’re doing. This is where tools like Slack and Trello would be very useful, especially if team members don’t all work in the same office.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
<p>Remove most distractions (though remember a bit of background music often helps improve workflow/concentration). Make sure team members take regular short breaks, but don’t have everyone take their break at the same time. Also make sure each team member knows their assigned task, and that they’re capable of completing it. Give incentives to your team, this could be bonus pay for completing tasks early, being allowed to leave early, playing games between tasks, prizes for the best/quickest workers etc. Remove obstacles to your workflow, ensure effective communication between team members, and make sure everybody has everything they need to complete the task at hand before they start.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.3: Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
<p>To improve my own productivity I wouldn’t use slack for a solo project as it serves no purpose. I would use it for team projects as it’s an easy way to communicate with my team and share links/code snippets etc.</p>
<p>I personally would not use Trello for a solo project, though I can see why some people would find it advantageous. For me in a solo project it’s just extra work to do.</p>
<br>
<h3>3.4: Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<p>Alpha and beta testing stages could be implemented. During the Alpha stage when the code is basically complete I’d use in house testing, mainly by getting the team that developed the code to use it, and try to find problems. For example on a website I’d assign a page or pages to different team members, have them test every aspect of the given page as thoroughly as they can; making sure all the links work, and point to the correct places, making sure all images appear where and as they should, making sure text is clearly legible etc. Then I’d repeat the test but swap the pages being tested between team members in case anyone missed anything.</p>
<p>Once all team members were happy that testing was complete to the best of their ability and all bugs had been found, I’d move on to the beta stage: Get outside testers in (someone from a different team, the end user/customer, or possibly even random members of the public) to have a look and see if they could find any problems.
