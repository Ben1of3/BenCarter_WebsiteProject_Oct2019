<h1>Develop Coding Assignment 2 Outcome 1</h1>
<br>
<h3>1.1: Describing the content and layout for each page </h3>
<br>
<p>The first page is a brief "about me" at the moment. It's got some funny pictures and lists a couple of my hobbies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>1.2: Plan and create your website </h3>
<p>Most of my website will rely on a single style sheet (which I'm calling "BenWeb.css" for now). One page will use a different sheet for alternative styling. Both styles will be dark/high conttrast themes featuring green on black as I like the colour combinbation.</p>
<p>Page 1 = index/front page. This is an "about me" page with a little info about myself and some of my hobbies.<br>
Page 2 = Assignment 1 outcome 1, 2 and 3 as directed.<br>
Page 3 = Assignment 2 outcome 1<br>
Page 4 = Game page (if I succeed in converting our python based text adventure into javascript to run on the page).<br>
Page 5 = Matrix: animatied aspects of the webpage, and youtube gaming videos - this page has it's own CSS sheet separate from the rest of the website.<br>
Page 6 = Joystick configs and 3DIR tracking</p>
<br>
<h3>1.3: Selecting and using web site features and structure </h3>
<p>Headers and body text?</p>
<p>I'm currently using h3 headers to outline each question. Body text is not being controlled by any sort of styles other than color and text shadows to keep it easily readable.</p>
<p>Header:</p>
<h3>Pixel Wizard</h3>
<p>Body text:</p>
<p>The body text will be the outcomes from assignments 1 and 2. For now I'm going to use an example of autogenerated garbage, aka "Lorem Ipsum" text:</P>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reiciendis enim veritatis delectus minus quam, officia doloribus beatae sapiente a illum tempore labore accusamus suscipit aliquam, error quis molestiae reprehenderit nulla! Non modi ipsa vel quasi ad placeat vitae corrupti ratione facilis nam, expedita totam earum nobis unde officiis. Sed odit quia expedita consectetur repellendus explicabo maxime aperiam illum tempora praesentium magnam, ea nihil voluptate quae eveniet! Facilis quidem in repudiandae. Accusamus error quam provident dolore sequi porro animi sapiente quidem voluptate adipisci culpa dolorem quaerat impedit hic totam est, amet consequuntur sunt ipsam facilis libero veniam similique eaque! Ducimus libero quibusdam reprehenderit quidem incidunt molestias praesentium molestiae porro a assumenda! Totam dolorum ipsum inventore velit ut, cumque, impedit accusantium enim recusandae error aspernatur incidunt ab sed tempore quaerat ullam esse aliquid! Quia possimus, nisi unde quaerat perferendis sed enim autem nostrum perspiciatis quidem amet eveniet explicabo voluptas, odio at. Laborum.</p>
<p>The finished product will include the answers for some of my coursework as the main body text, instead of lorem ipsum text, however I'll leave the snippet above as an example.</p>
<p>Images?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm currently using a variety of images and image formats across the website.</p>
<p>Video?</p>
<p>See page 5 for a collection of youtube videos.</p>
<p>Audio?</p>
<p>Possibly... I might decide to scare you with some random death metal. There will of course be audio with the youtube videos (I accept no responsibility for the content of said videos)</p>
<p>User input?</p>
<p>Probably not in this instance. I'm making something that I hope is entertaining but won't require any input other than clicking on links (this does not apply to the game page if I get it working).</p>
<br>
<h3>1.4 Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent </h3>
<br>
<p>When selecting styles, keeping text clarity is important. If users have trouble reading the body of text on your website, be it the main script for your blog, an item description that the customer is considering buying, or simply update notes, then making sure it is easy to read is paramount.</p>
<p>A website with text that’s hard to read, be it too small, an awkward font, poor colour choice for text/background, is a website that people won’t enjoy using.</p>
<p>Keeping the main text clear can be achieved in a number of ways: Sticking to a set font style and size helps, but sometimes you may want your text to overlap an image; in this case black text with a white outline is generally considered the best practice, as it retains readability regardless of the coloured background of the image.</p>
<br>
<p>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </p>
<br>
<p>Copyrights may affect the content you can host on your website. Unauthorised use of copyrighted materials can cause legal difficulties, and even get your website shutdown and the hardware used to create/host it confiscated in extreme cases (you may have seen news articles about the illegal download sites such as the PirateBay, on sites like torrentfreak for a well known example). </p>
<p>
<p>When using anything that’s been created by someone else, to keep yourself (and your website!) out of trouble:</p>
<br>
1 Assume It’s Protected<br>
2 Read Click-Wrap Agreements<br>
3 Remove Unauthorized Material<br>
4 Investigate Claims Promptly<br>
5 When in Doubt, Seek Permission<br>
<br>
<p>Source used for fair use information:<br>
<br>
<a class=link href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/website-permissions/websites/">Stanford, permissions</a></br>
<p>There’s a lot of stuff available that’s free for personal use on the internet. There’s less content that’s free for commercial use, but it’s out there. Always check copyright statements, unless the content in question is in the public domain:</p>
<p>
“ABSOLUTELY FREE! MUSIC, TEXT, AND ART!! COPY ALL YOU WANT!! If you saw an advertisement like this, you might wonder, “What’s the catch?” When it comes to the public domain, there is no catch. If a book, song, movie, or artwork is in the public domain, then it is not protected by intellectual property laws (copyright, trademark, or patent laws)—which means it’s free for you to use without permission.” </p>
<p><a class=link href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/">Stanford, Public Domain</a></button></p>
<p>You can still use some copyrighted content under fair use rules. For instance if you want to host a parody version of something for entertainment, and don’t intend to make money from it (in some cases you can still make money from it as well, but assume not to be on the safe side).</p>
<br>
<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h3>
<br>
<p>People with poor eyesight may use tools built into the operating system, such as a screen magnifier, changing dpi settings, or simply zooming in on the website to help them read something more clearly. Users with extreme myopia may benefit from third party tools that perform a similar but more pronounced functions such as ZoomText. There are also hardware screen magnifiers, panels that clip over the screen and magnify a specific region (or even the whole screen). In extreme cases, text to voice applications can be used, or braille readers. Some websites even have some of these features integrated.</p>
<p>On the other side of the scale, people with hearing difficulties may use things like subtitles to replace speech, and annotations for more description/information in a video.</p>
<p>People with extreme mobility issues such as paraplegics who can’t use their arms to interact with a computer can still use the internet and access webpages:</p>
<p>Head tracking systems are one possibility (I actually created my own 3D IR head tracking system using an old web cam and some IR LEDs for use in PC games that support the head tracking feature).</p>
<p>There are also eye tracking solutions for those who can’t even move their head, a camera watches the users eyes, so the computer know where they are looking. They can activate actions by blinking.</p>
<p>Yet another option is voice activation: While some sort of voice activated system is included in most modern operating systems (Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Assistant, and more recently Amazon’s Alexa) they are generally limited to specific tasks such as basic computer operations, sending email for instance. They are however improving in reliability, usability, performance and scope very quickly as the technology becomes more popular. Again there are third party options that have more functionality, such as “VoiceAttack”, a program popular with some gamers for automating certain tasks to be activated with specific commands.</p>
<br>
<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>
<br>
<p>Html files contain the body of the website. Sometimes this can be plain text, even stored in simple .txt files.</p>
<p>For images, .jpeg (and variations of) or .png are usually the preferred file format, while videos may be stored in a variety of formats (.avi, .mp4, .vob, .mkv, .flv etc) depending on  the video compression method used. While flash (.flv) is falling out of popularity due to numerous problems and constraints it presents (various security issues for instance), it is still one of the most widely used video and best known formats online.</p>
<p>Audio files are usually stored as .mp3 (compressed) or .wav/.aiff (lossless, no compression artefacts/noise), though .flac is becoming more popular for websites requiring lossless audio.</p>
<p>Some websites even still use .mid for midi files (think of the Mario theme tune on a NES, and you’ll get the idea!).</p>
<br>
<h3>1.8 Storing and retrieving files effectively</h3>
<br>
<p>There are many methods that can be used for storing files.</p>
Offsite data backups use the internet and copy files to a remote server
Large corporations may have network drives for users to save files to, meaning they can access their files from any computer connected to the network.
Portable storage such as CD/DVD/USB/SD cards and so on can be used for transportation and storage of non-sensitive data. It should NOT used for sensitive data such as customer information unless the data can be encrypted to a sufficient level to make it unusable to anyone without the encryption key.
System storage where files are saved locally to the computer being used can be suitable for some operations, but is generally not advised in a “hotdesk” scenario where multiple users may have access to the system. Regardless, data backups are still highly advisable.
Always remember to do your backups, whether it’s to another machine such as a workplace server, an offsite server, or a portable device.    </p>
<p>For the purpose of file retrieval on my website, I've kept it simple. Everything is contained either within the main folder. HTML files for each page, CSS sheets, an images folder for all the images I'm using. There's also fonts and audio folders, though I've not had time to implement the use of them yet.</p>
<p>I've used hot links to youtube for the videos I've included on my webpage. On the college's slow wireless connection thesee can take a short while to load properly.</p>
