        <h1>THE SOCIETY OF GREY BEARDS</h1><br>
        <p>Once they were young, fearless, the pick of the Pilots Federation's new generation, hero's in the making. Now they are greying, jaded, cynical, and sarcastic. The years have been hard, the battles innumerable, the glory scant, the rewards paltry.</p>
        <p>Watching the new generation grab glory and rewards unearned and out of proportion to their skill and time served, they have decided to take matters into their own hands, to make part of the galaxy their own, to take what they deserve by force if needed. Dismissed as relics of a bygone age no one saw them coming, and when they came they mocked them as "grey bearded old farts".</p>

<h4>They mock no more!</h4>
