                <h1>THE SOCIETY OF GREY BEARDS</h1><br>
                <p>Once they were young, fearless, the pick of the Pilots Federation's new generation, hero's in the making. Now they are greying, jaded, cynical, and sarcastic. The years have been hard, the battles innumerable, the glory scant, the rewards paltry.</p>
                <p>Watching the new generation grab glory and rewards unearned and out of proportion to their skill and time served, they have decided to take matters into their own hands, to make part of the galaxy their own, to take what they deserve by force if needed. Dismissed as relics of a bygone age no one saw them coming, and when they came they mocked them as "grey bearded old farts".</p>

                <div class="row">
                        <div class="column1">
                                <p>After much work was done by the individual pilots at various hotspots of criminal activity, and many tons of cargo was hauled for needy systems, the respect deserved just wasn’t felt. In 3303 CMDR Zantar filed with the Pilots Federation an application for that recognition.</p>
                                <p>8 Months past and that recognition was given, the Society of Greybeards was officially made a minor faction by the Pilots Federation and granted the home system of Cartu.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to SOGB at the time, in the nearby system of Velliep, the Galactic Consortium of Billionaires had been making plans to expand into Cartu… Working to push out a faction when that faction was moved by the Pilots Federation and SOGB was given the system.</p>
                                <p>For reasons unknown to this day GCOB seemed to take great offense to this action, even though it was entirely out of SOGB hands at the time. As SOGB made efforts to seize control of Cartu, efforts were being made to ensure that it did not happen, at this time, SOGB knew nothing about these plans and our efforts for Cartu was thwarted.</p> 
                                <p>We were able to ascertain that the Chapterhouse of the Inquisition were working against us for fear of our intentions to Arissa Lavigny-Duval. After some diplomacy, the Inquisition stood down. Cartu was quickly taken</p>
                                <p>It was around this time that GCOB’s wishes were brought to our attention and negotiations began, we simply wished to be able to expand and occupy other systems but GCOB flat out refused to agree about us expanding into any imperial systems, however, we expanded into Gamma Mensae and looked around after taking full control there. Systems available to us were highly limited.</p>    
                        </div>
                        <div class="column2">
                                <p>Our requests to GCOB to reopen negotiations and allow us to expand further fell on deaf ears. An opportunity to expand arose: we hoped to use Soch; a GCOB occupied system to springboard into safer areas less likely to attract conflict. As it was SOGB had gained full control of both Cartu and Gamma Mensae and were now effectively trapped in these two systems.</p>
                                <p>Soch was expanded into without detection, and we seized control, during the attempt to push for expansion GCOB pushed back and triggered a second war… this time with Lavigny's Legion supporting them, we were a squadron of approximately 25 pilots. GCOB public records showed 4 times that number, and the Legion's records showed 7 times that of GCOB at the time.</p>
                                <p>Outnumbered 11 to 1, the Beards fought fiercely. The battle raged on for a week, SOGB was victorious; and LL were prepared to negotiate on GCOB's behalf.</p>
                                <p>As talks continued we expanded into Jurokkju and it became a negotiation option. But because of GCOB's internal strife and LL's siding with us on grounds of reason Soch was ours to keep, many GCOB joined LL and we were given authority to crush all remains of GCOB.</p>
                                <p>Since then, SOGB have achieved 1st place in trade on the squadron leaderboards earning a dashboard trophy for all its members at the time and has up to the end of October of 3305, obtained a presence in 6 systems, control of 5 with full control of 5 systems and a total of 17 Starports under their control.</p>
                                <p>To this day, the Legion still remains uncertain as to how a squadron of a mere 25 pushed back the might of the Legion and their allies… With hundreds of pilots at their disposal.</p>
