        <p>Most people know that the better mission rewards are offered to those with the best standing with the given faction. The fastest way to gain good standing is by doing missions for the chosen faction and selecting [REP +] rewards, the more "+" the higher the reward effect.</p>
        <p>Ok, that was fun, and you are now the greatest pilot in the galaxy, or at least all the local factions in the area believe so, now what?</p>

            <h3>SUPPORTING YOUR CHOSEN FACTION</h3>
            <p>All positive actions and completing missions and selecting [INF +] will increase that factions influence within the system, once they are 60%+ in influence there is a chance they will begin expansion (covered later). Once a faction’s influence gets within 5% of another faction, it can trigger a conflict.</p>
            <p>A conflict can be peaceful (elections for example) or hostile (war for example)</p>
            <p>Peaceful conflicts require appropriate missions to be successfully completed. Hostile conflicts are resolved with pew pew.</p>
            <p>A conflict will last a maximum of 7 days under "Matchplay" rules, in the background, each conflict zone completed (win or lose) is given a score based on its size. Secondary missions add to this score and at the BGS tick, the side with the higher score wins the day. Best out of 7 (first to win 4 days). At the end of which, the winning side gains 4%, the losers drop 4%.</p>
            <p>The benefit of conflicts is that the winning side will gain in decreasing value, the greatest station of the losing side (and if the losers are the system controlling faction, system control) down to the least valuable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
            <h3>FORCING A FACTION TO RETREAT</h3>
            <p>This is harder, but not impossible. You have to lower the target factions influence to below 2.5% and for 5 days during the retreat, keep them below 2.5% this means DO NOT COMPLETE MISSIONS FOR THEM even if they are to "help them retreat". Completed missions increase inf.</p>
            <p>The most efficient way to reduce inf is to carefully track influence gains. What you do for one faction, you must do for all factions for example, if a system has 7 factions, you want one out, you must do missions for the other 6 factions.</p> 
            <p>If you was to earn [15 INF +] for one faction, you must earn the same for the other 5 factions, or else if you earn more for 5 factions, but less for the 6th, it CAN have a positive effect on the 7th faction - the one you want out.</p>
            <p>The best method is to earn [5 INF +] for each of the factions except the one you want out.</p>
            <p>The more squadron members doing the same, the more likely you'll get the maximum decrease (increase max too if supporting the faction) of 5% per BGS tick.</p>

<div class="container"><h3>EXPANSION</h3>
    <p>It is not hard to figure out where a faction will expand to…</p>

    <ol><li> Must be within 15ly</li>
        <li> The system must have room for the faction (6 or fewer factions in the system already)</li>
        <li> If there are 2 or more systems that qualify, the expanding faction will expand to the nearest.</li></ol>
        <br>
    <p>If there are no suitable systems within 15ly, the faction (while maintaining a high enough influence) will enter an investment phase… the range is then increased another 15ly.</p>
